              Hi, I'm CodeBucks, a web developer and UI/UX designer with a
              passion for creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered
              digital experiences. With 4 years of experience in the field. I am
              always looking for new and innovative ways to bring my clients'
              visions to life.
            </p>
            <p className="my-4 font-medium dark:text-light">
              I believe that design is about more than just making things look
              pretty â€“ it's about solving problems and creating intuitive,
              enjoyable experiences for users.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium dark:text-light">
              Whether I'm working on a website, mobile app, or other digital
              product, I bring my commitment to design excellence and
              user-centered thinking to every project I work on. I look forward
              to the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to your next
              project.
